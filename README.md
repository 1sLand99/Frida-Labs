# Frida-labs

This repository contains a series of challenges designed for learning Frida for Android. These are not like hardcore Capture The Flag (CTF) applications but will help you to start with Frida and its commonly used APIs. If you are entirely new to Frida, this is the perfect repository to get started. I have organized the challenges in a way that covers everything from the basics to an intermediate level.

These challenges have flags but that's not the primary goal here. You can easily get the flags using other methods.But the goal of these challenges is to equip you with the fundamentals, helping you to use Frida and understand the Frida scripts written by others. While doing these challenges, try to obtain the flag through many ways as possible using frida.I will be updating this repository with new challenges whenever I find something interesting.

All the APKs are inside the directories, and the solutions are also provided in the solution directory. If you are not familiar with the setup and have no idea about Frida, you can go through the first solution. 

If you find this series useful please share :)
