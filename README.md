# Frida-labs

This repository contains a series of challenges designed for learning Frida for Android. It is not a hardcore Capture The Flag (CTF) application but aims to familiarize you with Frida and its commonly used APIs. If you are new to Frida, this is the perfect repository to get started. I have organized the challenges in a way that covers everything from the basics to an intermediate level.

These challenges are CTF-like challenges, they also include flags, but this series is not about finding these flags. You can easily get the flags using other methods. The goal of these challenges is to equip you with the fundamentals, helping you to use Frida and understand the Frida scripts written by others. I will be updating this repository with new challenges whenever I find something interesting.

All the APKs are inside the directories, and the solutions are also provided in the solution directory. If you are not familiar with the setup and have no idea about Frida, you can go through the first solution.
